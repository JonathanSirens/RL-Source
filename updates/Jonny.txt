Game Updates:
A bug where you would open spirit shard packs and your shards bug out has been fixed.

Polls:
Should ghost down be removed from the game and replaced with revenants spread throughout the wilderness?
Should a middle man rank be added to the game, this would be set up similar to applying for Server Support but be purely based on how trusted you are.
Should a option be added to your friends list to teleport a friend to you? You would only be able to use this option if they have you added back and both of you are not in the wilderness.
