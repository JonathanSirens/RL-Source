Game Updates:
The dragon defender that you get in treasure island is now the real dragon defender.
The dragon warhammer inventory model is now fixed.

Polls:
Should ghost town be removed from the game and replaced with revenants spread throughout the wilderness?
Should a middle man rank be added to the game, this would be set up similar to applying for Server Support but be purely based on how trusted you are.
Should a option be added to your friends list to teleport a friend to you? You would only be able to use this option if they have you added back and both of you are not in the wilderness.
Should donator ranks have experience boosts depending on what rank it is? (This would stack with double experience weekends)
Should aqua items be renamed to 'water' and made a little bit more blue?
Should we allow donators to change their in-game name via the person at ::dzone? This would be for free and only be able to be done once every 25 days.
Should edgeville be changed to the version of edgeville from the 634 revision? (2010+ RuneScape)
Should you be able to teleport directly to your wilderness target? You would not be allowed to teleport to your target if over 30 wilderness or in combat.
